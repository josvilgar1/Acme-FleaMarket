This is the Acme-FleaMarket project, which is intended to be a core learning asset for the students
who have enroled the Design and Testing subject of the Software Engineering curriculum of the 
University of Sevilla.  This project provides a template our students can use to get their projects 
up and running very quickly.


## v1.0.0
**Entities**
-Advertisement: for this entity, we acknowledged to treat the display period with two Date datatypes inicialDate meaning the
	beginning of the period and finalDate meaning the end of the period.

## v3.0.0
**Entities**
-Figment: The price range property has been modified by two attributes of type Money.

## v5.0.0
**Entities**
-Buyer: The @Column(unique = true) annotation in the email column has been deleted because it is not requested in the requirements.
-Buyer: The @Column(unique = true) annotation in the phone column has been deleted because it is not requested in the requirements.
-Item: The @NotBlank annotation in the email ticker has been deleted because it is an autogenerated attribute.

**Framework**
-AbstractDeleteService: A default method has been added in the abstract interface because we have encountered a problem
	when validating a form with the readonly condition equal to true. It returned the error but not the values of the model when
	readonly, so we have set the entity values to the model.
-Launcher: We have added the initialization of our SpamUtil bean when launching the application to have the words spam at 
	the beginning of the application
